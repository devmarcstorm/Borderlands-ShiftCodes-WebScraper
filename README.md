# BlCodeScraper

> A web scraper for the ShiftCodes of the Borderlands video games

## Installing

I have created an .exe for Windows. This can be easily downloaded and executed.
- [Releases](https://github.com/devmarcstorm/Borderlands-ShiftCodes-WebScraper/releases)

To run the source code, you must first install the requirements.
You'll also need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) along with Pip.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can run the scraper_ui.py.
```
python scraper_ui.py
```
